# React Video Room System ðŸ“¹

Welcome to the React Video Room System project! This repository contains the implementation of a simple room-based system where users can join video call rooms. The system efficiently manages multiple peer connections, ensuring low latency and synchronized state across clients.

## Features ðŸš€

- **Room-based System**: Users can join different rooms for video calls.
- **Multiple Peer Connections**: Efficient management of peer-to-peer connections using WebRTC.
- **Low Latency**: Ensures minimal delay for smooth communication.
- **Synchronized State**: Changes made by one user are reflected in real-time for all users in the same room.

## Technologies Used ðŸ’»

- **React.js**: Frontend development library for building user interfaces.
- **WebRTC**: Real-time communication protocol for establishing peer-to-peer connections.
